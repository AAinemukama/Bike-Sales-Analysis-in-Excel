# Bike Sales -Customer Demographics Analysis Using Microsoft Excel
## Project Description
### Project Description
In this bike sales project, Microsoft Excel was utilized to clean, standardize, and analyze the data. The primary goal was to provide a comprehensive overview of buyer demographics to better understand the target market. This involved identifying which groups are more likely to make purchases based on factors such as age, gender, and marital status. An interactive dashboard was then created to visualize the data and insights.
## Key Features
- Data Preparation
- Creation of pivot tables and charts (dashboard)

### Data Preparation
The initial step in this Excel project involved preparing the data for analysis. This included:

#### Data Cleaning:
##### Standardizing Fields: 
Replaced short form values with their full form equivalents. For example:
M was replaced with Married
F was replaced with Female
##### Creating Age Groups: 
Categorized the Age field into distinct age groups for better analysis. For example:
- Ages < 35 were grouped as Millenial
- Ages 36-60 were grouped as Middle Age
- Ages 61 and above were grouped as Late Adulthood
This data preparation ensured consistency and facilitated more meaningful analysis in subsequent steps.
